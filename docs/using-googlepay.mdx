## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### 1. Obtain the Google Pay Payment Data Response

When a customer completes a payment through Google Pay, you'll receive a `GooglePayPaymentDataResponse`. This response contains the necessary payment details.

### 2. Construct the API Request Payload

In your API request to Revolv3, include the `GooglePayPaymentDataResponse` within the `GooglePay` object of the `PaymentMethod`. Here's a sample JSON payload:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
      "IncludeRawProcessorResponse": true,
      "PaymentMethod": {
          "merchantPaymentMethodRefId": "1235-12345-ljd123",
          "GooglePay": {
              "GooglePayPaymentDataResponse": "{\"apiVersionMinor\":0,\"apiVersion\":2,\"paymentMethodData\":{\"description\":\"Visa •••• 1111\",\"tokenizationData\":{\"type\":\"PAYMENT_GATEWAY\",\"token\":\"41111111111111111\"},\"type\":\"CARD\",\"info\":{\"cardNetwork\":\"VISA\",\"cardDetails\":\"1111\"}}}"
          }
          "BillingAddress": {
              "AddressLine1": "381 Forest Ave. Suite C",
              "City": "Laguna Beach",
              "State": "CA",
              "PostalCode": "92651",
              "Country": "USA"
          }
      },
      "Invoice": {
          "MerchantInvoiceRefId": "123456789",
          "Amount": {
              "Currency": "USD",
              "Value": "12.20"
          }
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Key Components Explained:

* **`IncludeRawProcessorResponse`**: Set to `true` to receive the raw response from the payment processor.
* **`merchantPaymentMethodRefId`**: A unique identifier for the payment method in your system.
* **`GooglePayPaymentDataResponse`**: The raw JSON string received from Google Pay. Make sure it is properly escaped.
* **`BillingAddress`**: The customer's billing address.
* **`Invoice`**: Details of the transaction, including a reference ID and the amount.

### 3. Handle the Response

After processing, Revolv3 will return a response with the payment status. Handle this response in your application to update the order status and notify the customer accordingly.

If the processor doesn't support it, you will get a 400 Bad request back

```
{
    "message": "Merchant does not have configured processor for payment method type GooglePay"
}
```
